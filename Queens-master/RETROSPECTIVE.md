# Queens Retrospective Document

This document is a retrospective of how the Queens team has performed in the past two iterations, how we intend on improving for the final iteration, and the success criteria that indicate if we were able to improve.

## Parts of the project that could be more successful
_1. Less code smells (more quality code)_  

Our most recent feedback had 5 code smells due to violations of SOLID principles. These code smells were usually the result of wanting to quickly implement a feature over carefully thinking of a robust design.

_2. Integrate a code review process_  

We could have received less code smells if we integrated a code review process before each large push to the repository. We have never had a code review session prior to this iteration, so integrated some form of code review could help reduce the amount of smells in our codebase.  

_3. Distribute work in a more effective way_  

The work distribution for each iteration could have been more effective if we know each other's strengths and weaknesses. 

_4. UI/UX_

The user interface and user experience in our application needs improvement. We need a more consistent interface that is very self-explanatory and easy-to-use.

## How we intend on improving for this iteration
_1. Refer to SOLID principles and design patterns when writing code_

By referring to SOLID principles and common software design patterns when writing code, we can reduce the amount of code smells in our codebase. We intend on leveraging the principles and design patterns discussed in class to improve our codebase.

_2. Formalize a process that encourages multiple team members to review code before being pushed_

We can formalize a code review process that encourages multiple team members to review code before being pushed, allowing for more opportunities for potential unnoticed code smells to surface. We intend on integrating a formal code review process that will take place before each large push to the repository.

_3. Figure out each team member's strengths/weaknesses and distribute work to maximize the efficiency of each member._

Figuring out each team member's preferences will allow us to distribute work in a way that maximizes the efficiency of each member, resulting in a generally more productive team. We intend on reviewing our strengths and weakness and distributing work accordingly.

_4. Redesign the UI with user experience in mind. Go for consistency._

The user interface for the Category management section of our application could be easier to use and more consistent with that of the Flashcard section. We intend on redesigning the Category management UI to look and feel more like the Flashcard management UI.

## Success criteria
1. Receiving 0-2 code smells after having the project reviewed by marker.
2. Initiate in at least 3 code reviews.
3. Each team member contributes to at least 1 issue in Gitlab.
4. The Category management UI looks and feels like the Flashcard management UI.
